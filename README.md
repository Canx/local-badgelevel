# moodle-local_badgelevel
Moodle plugin that awards badges when user levels up in "block_xp" and "block_showgrade" plugins.

# Prerequisites
As admin install the [xp](https://github.com/FMCorz/moodle-block_xp) or [showgrade](https://github.com/Canx/moodle-block_showgrade) block.

As a teacher add an "xp" or "showgrade" block to your course and make sure you created at least one course badge in the course admin page.

# Usage
As a teacher, navigate to "course administration", then to the "Badges" section and click in the new "Award badges when leveling up" link.

You will be able to choose the blocks added and link their levels to badges.

Now as a user try to achieve one of the levels linked to a badge using the block criteria and check that you get the badge award notification!
